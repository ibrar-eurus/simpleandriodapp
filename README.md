# Open Source Android Weather Application

Beginner friendly open source android application. The main mission of this project is to provide android enthusiast with a platform where they can advance their skills in most popular libraries and design concepts. You may wonder - why we chose a weather app? The answer is simple - it turns out that weather application can cover just about every topic of modern android development.

## FAQ:

<i>Q - I found a bug and I can't (or donâ€™t want to) fix it, how can I add it to the issues list?</i>

<i>Q - I found a bug and I want to fix it, is it ok if I just do that and make a pull request?</i>

<i>Q - There is no issue for the bug that I found and want to fix, what should I do?</i>
  
<b>A - It is recommended that you submit a new issue, get that issue assigned on you, and then work on it. Just write a comment under the corresponding issue s.a. <i>"..I would like to work on this issue.."</i> However, if the amount of expected work is relatively small (< 1 day), you can simply fix the bug and make a pull request right away.</b>

<i>Q - I want to work on an issue, can I work on it right away?</i>
